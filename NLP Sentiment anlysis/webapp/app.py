#         ## What is Sentiment Analysis?
#         Sentiment Analysis is like reading people's minds! Well, kind of. It's a technique that computers use to understand if the words people write are happy, sad, or neutral. This way, companies know what their customers are feeling about their products or services.

#         ## How does BERT help in Sentiment Analysis?
#         Imagine understanding all the languages in the world! BERT is like that. It's a brain for the computer that understands not just words, but also the context, like sarcasm or excitement. It's super smart because it got trained with lots of books, websites, and all sorts of writings. So, when you tell BERT about any sentence or a review, it can tell if it's a happy, sad, or meh message.

#         ## The Magic Behind Training BERT
#         BERT went to a special school called 'Fine-tuning' where it learned about specific stuff like product reviews. It read millions of comments about different products, like toys, phones, or pizzas, understanding what makes customers happy or grumpy. Now, BERT is like a sentiment wizard for all sorts of product reviews!
